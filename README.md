# GALLY

## Strategies

### branch-to-master

Test the updated projects between current branch and master

### previous-commit

On `master` branch test the updated projects the previous commit

- It works with git
- No nested project - at least for now
- Only one comparison strategy for now: compare files updated on current to master
